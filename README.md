## What is Naos?

A platform for creators to share their projects and connect with like-minded collaborators. It implements a system similar to Tinder, where projects are recommended to users on a descriptive card. Users can then either swipe right for more information or swipe left to keep searching through the database of projects.

## How does it work?

Naos uses a sophisticated recommendation algorithm in order to quickly direct users to projects that are uniquely specific to their wants and needs. On the frontend, all the project cards displayed are stored in a database, which is then seamlessly communicated from the backend server to what the user sees. User authentication, registration, and login allows for easy access to user-specific functionalities of Naos from wherever they so choose to work. 

## Technologies used:
* Backend: Javascript, Express, MongoDB, and NodeJS
* Frontend: HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for the frontend

Don't forget to add securedata.json in the cloned repo containing mongo db url and admin data to run backend!
